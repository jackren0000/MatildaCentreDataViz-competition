### **Matilda Centre DataViz: Visualizing Mental Health Stories 🧠✨**

This project was my entry into the Matilda Centre Data Visualization competition! The challenge? To use data to tell a compelling story about mental health and/or substance use, especially focusing on Indigenous Australians. I chose to highlight the critical issue of "Indigenous Mental Health and Substance Use" and "Stolen Generations and Mental Health."

#### **Our Creative Process 🎨**

1.  **Finding Our Voice (Theme):** We decided to focus on the powerful and important themes of Indigenous mental health and substance use, including the lasting impact of the Stolen Generations.

2.  **Hunting for Data 📊:** I scoured various resources, including the Indigenous Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Clearinghouse, to gather relevant data on mental health conditions and substance use among Indigenous Australians.

3.  **Platform of Choice: Tableau! 💻:** For this competition, I chose Tableau to create a sophisticated and interactive data visualization. It's a fantastic tool for bringing data to life and telling a clear story.

4.  **Crafting the Narrative 📖:** The goal wasn't just pretty charts; it was to tell a story. My visualization aims to highlight important issues and spark conversations around these critical topics.

#### **Tech We Used 🛠️**

*   Tableau (for visualization)
*   Various data sources (CSV, Excel)

#### **Want to See the Story? 🚀**

Since this is a data visualization project, the best way to experience it is to view the Tableau dashboard directly (if hosted publicly) or the static images in the `charts` directory.

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jackren0000/MatildaCentreDataViz-competition.git
    ```
2.  **Explore the visualizations:**
    *   Check the `charts` directory for static images.
    *   Look for a link to the Tableau Public dashboard in the project files (if available).
