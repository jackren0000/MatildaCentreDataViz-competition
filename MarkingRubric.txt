Fifteen of the top entries, as voted by an expert advisory committee, will be selected for judging and public voting. 
These entries will be judged by 3 academic/professional staff members of the Matilda Centre and 1 judge external to the Matilda Centre, according to the following criteria (10 points for each):

1. Story told and insights offered about mental health and/or substance use 
2. Creativity and aesthetic appeal 
3. Effective communication

The fifteen top entries will also be posted to an online site to facilitate public voting. 
(Links to the survey will be shared via the Matilda Centre, and will be emailed to all entrants. Please encourage your networks to vote!)
